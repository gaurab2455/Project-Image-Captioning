# Project-Image-Captioning

Trained a Deep learning models consisting of LSTM, Convolutional Neural Net and Recurrent Neural Net which can generate caption for a given input Image.

## Highlights of Model
- Used 8k Images for training from the Flickr8k dataset.
- Processed Image as well as text data using the concept of Transfer Language.
- Built over pre-trained ResNet50 model and GloVe 6B.50d(consist of 6 billion words represented as a 50 dimension vector).
- Used concepts of Deep learning such as CNN, RNN, and LSTM.

## Industrial Application
- Self driving cars — Automatic driving is one of the biggest challenges and if we can properly caption the scene around the car, it can give a boost to the self driving system.
- Aid to the blind — We can create a product for the blind which will guide them travelling on the roads without the support of anyone else. We can do this by first converting the scene into text and then the text to voice. Both are now famous applications of Deep Learning. Refer this link where its shown how Nvidia research is trying to create such a product.
- CCTV cameras are everywhere today, but along with viewing the world, if we can also generate relevant captions, then we can raise alarms as soon as there is some malicious activity going on somewhere. This could probably help reduce some crime and/or accidents.
- Automatic Captioning can help, make Google Image Search as good as Google Search, as then every image could be first converted into a caption and then search can be performed based on the caption.
